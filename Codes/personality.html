            <h3>Personality Test Results</h3>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                I found the test to be quite accurate in describing me personally. It highlighted my strengths, such as being analytical and organized, which align with how I see myself. However, I also recognize that personality tests like this have limitations and may not capture the full complexity of an individual. Overall, I believe the test provides a useful framework for self-reflection and personal growth.

            <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy:
                <ul>
                    <li>Playing video games.</li>
                    <li>Playing basketball.</li>
                    <li>Watching movies and TV shows.</li>
	            <li>Excersing, specifically lifting weights and occasionally some running/cardio.</li>
		    <li>These hobbies are indictive of who am I. Individually, they look like a waste of time but combined they are essential in living a quality life. It is important not to overdue each one.</li>	
                </ul>

            <h3>My Hero/Mentor</h3>
            <p>
                My hero is <strong>Bob Marley</strong>. I admire his vision, determination, and ability to express himself through music.From classics like "One Love" to "Natural Mystic, his melodies and lyrics captivate the mind and relaxes the body.His relentless pursuit of musical excellence inspires me to think big and work hard to achieve my dreams.
            My favourite quote by <strong>Bob Marley</strong> is <strong>The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively.</strong>
